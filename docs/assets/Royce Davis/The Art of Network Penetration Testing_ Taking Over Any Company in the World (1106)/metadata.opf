You’ll take on the role of the attacker and work through every stage of a professional pentest, from information gathering to seizing control of a system and owning the network.Summary Penetration testing is about more than just getting through a perimeter firewall. The biggest security threats are inside the network, where attackers can rampage through sensitive data by exploiting weak access controls and poorly patched software. Designed for up-and-coming security professionals, The Art of Network Penetration Testing teaches you how to take over an enterprise network from the inside. It lays out every stage of an internal security assessment step-by-step, showing you how to identify weaknesses before a malicious invader can do real damage.
