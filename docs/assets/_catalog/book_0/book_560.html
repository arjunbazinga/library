    order to develop a secure defense against a hostile alien
    race's next attack, government agencies breed child geniuses
    and train them as soldiers. A brilliant young boy, Andrew
    "Ender" Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his
    sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than
    anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were
    candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the
    cut--young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle
    School for rigorous military training. Ender's skills make him
    a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where
    children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up
    in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers
    greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from
    the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien
    invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear
    that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and
    fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister. Is Ender
    the general Earth needs? But Ender is not the only result of
    the genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been
    raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect
    general has been underway for almost as long. Ender's two older
    siblings are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very
    different ways. Between the three of them lie the abilities to
    remake a world. If, that is, the world survives. Born in
    Richland, Washington, in 1951, Orson Scott Card grew up in
    California, Arizona, and Utah. He lived in Brazil for two years
    as an unpaid missionary for the Mormon Church and received
    degrees from Brigham Young University (1975) and the University
    of Utah (1981). The author of numerous books, Card was the
    first writer to receive both the Hugo and Nebula awards for
    best novel two years in a row, first for "Ender's Game" and
    then for the sequel "Speaker for the Dead." He lives with his
    wife and children in North Carolina. Winner of the Hugo and

    An increasingly popular and relevant novel that risks and
    achieves and delivers more than most anything else within the
    science fiction genre, "Ender's Game" is a contemporary
    classic--a work, as Gene Wolf has written, that "will still be
    finding new readers when 99 percent of the books published this
    year are completely forgotten." "'Intense' is the word for
    "Ender's Game.""--"The New York Times" "An affecting novel full
    of surprises that seem inevitable once they are explained. The
    key, of course, is Ender Wiggin himself. Mr. Card never makes
    the mistake of patronizing or sentimentalizing his hero.
    Alternately likable and insufferable, his is a convincing
    little Napoleon in short pants."--Gerald Jonas, "The New York
    Times Book Review" "A gripping tale of adventure in space and a
    scathing indictment of the military mind."--"Library Journal"
    "This twenty-five-year-old science fiction classic [is] unlike
    many hardcore SF titles [in that it] is particularly
    appropriate for a younger audience, for its protagonist, Ender
    Wiggin, is just six years old at the novel's beginning and
    still a pre-teen at its end. Ender's parents have received a
    special dispensation to have a third child in spite of strict
    population control laws. [Ender's] brilliant older siblings,
    Peter and Valentine, have each showed great promise, but each
    falls just short of having 'the right stuff.' The International
    Fleet (I.F.) believes that Ender may be the commander they need
    to lead great armies against invasion by alien 'buggers.' When
    Ender does exhibit the desired combination of compassion and
    cruelty, the I.F. takes him to the distant Battle School, where
    brilliant children are trained in military strategy and
    tactics. The centerpiece of their education is a simulated
    battle game at which Ender quickly excels, eventually becoming
    the youngest commander in history. Life at Battle School,
    especially [its many] battle games, is richly described. Ender
    is portrayed as just a pawn in the larger game being played by
    the I.F., and readers will alternately sympathize with his
    exploitation and cheer when he is able to make friends in spite
    of the tremendous forces working to isolate and dehumanize him
    . . . For the most part, this novel will deservedly reach a new
    generation."--Norah Piehl, "Children's Literature" "Card has
    taken the venerable SF concepts of a superman and interstellar
    war against aliens, and, with superb characterization, pacing,
    and language, combined them into a seamless story of compelling
    power. This is Card at the height of his very considerable
    powers--a major SF novel by any reasonable
    standards."--"Booklist"</p>
