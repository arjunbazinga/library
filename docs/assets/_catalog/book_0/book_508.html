                                At least one-third of the people we know are introverts.
    They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking, reading to
    partying; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion;
    who favor working on their own over brainstorming in teams.
    Although they are often labeled "quiet," it is to introverts
    that we owe many of the great contributions to society--from
    van Gogh&rsquo;s sunflowers to the invention of the personal
    computer.

                                Passionately argued, impressively researched, and filled
    with indelible stories of real people, 
    <em>Quiet</em> shows how dramatically we undervalue introverts,
    and how much we lose in doing so. Taking the reader on a
    journey from Dale Carnegie&rsquo;s birthplace to Harvard
    Business School, from a Tony Robbins seminar to an evangelical
    megachurch, Susan Cain charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal
    in the twentieth century and explores its far-reaching effects.
    She talks to Asian-American students who feel alienated from
    the brash, backslapping atmosphere of American schools. She
    questions the dominant values of American business culture,
    where forced collaboration can stand in the way of innovation,
    and where the leadership potential of introverts is often
    overlooked. And she draws on cutting-edge research in
    psychology and neuroscience to reveal the surprising
    differences between extroverts and introverts.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Perhaps most inspiring, she introduces us to successful
    introverts--from a witty, high-octane public speaker who
    recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking
    salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Finally,
    she offers invaluable advice on everything from how to better
    negotiate differences in introvert-extrovert relationships to
    how to empower an introverted child to when it makes sense to
    be a "pretend extrovert."

                                    <strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, January 2012</strong>:
    How many introverts do you know? The real answer will probably
    surprise you. In our culture, which emphasizes group work from
    elementary school through the business world, everything seems
    geared toward extroverts. Luckily, introverts everywhere have a
    new spokesperson: Susan Cain, a self-proclaimed introvert
    who&rsquo;s taken it upon herself to better understand the
    place of introverts in culture and society. With 
    <em>Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can&rsquo;t
    Stop Talking</em>, Cain explores introversion through
    psychological research old and new, personal experiences, and
    even brain chemistry, in an engaging and highly-readable
    fashion. By delving into introversion, Cain also seeks to find
    ways for introverts and extroverts to better understand one
    another--and for introverts to understand their own
    contradictions, such as the ability to act like extroverts in
    certain situations. Highly accessible and uplifting for any
    introvert--and any extrovert who knows an introvert (and over
    one-third of us are introverts)--
    <em>Quiet</em> has the potential to revolutionize the
    &ldquo;extrovert ideal.&rdquo;

    <strong>A:</strong> For the same reason that Betty Friedan
    published 
    <em>The Feminine Mystique</em> in 1963. Introverts are to
    extroverts what women were to men at that time--second-class
    citizens with gigantic amounts of untapped talent. Our schools,
    workplaces, and religious institutions are designed for
    extroverts, and many introverts believe that there is something
    wrong with them and that they should try to &ldquo;pass&rdquo;
    as extroverts. The bias against introversion leads to a
    colossal waste of talent, energy, and, ultimately,
    happiness.

                                    <strong>Q: What personal significance does the subject have for
    you?</strong>
    
                                <br>
                                    <strong>A:</strong> When I was in my twenties, I started
    practicing corporate law on Wall Street. At first I thought I
    was taking on an enormous challenge, because in my mind, the
    successful lawyer was comfortable in the spotlight, whereas I
    was introverted and occasionally shy. But I soon realized that
    my nature had a lot of advantages: I was good at building loyal
    alliances, one-on-one, behind the scenes; I could close my
    door, concentrate, and get the work done well; and like many
    introverts, I tended to ask a lot of questions and listen
    intently to the answers, which is an invaluable tool in
    negotiation. I started to realize that there&rsquo;s a lot more
    going on here than the cultural stereotype of the
    introvert-as-unfortunate would have you believe. I had to know
    more, so I spent the past five years researching the powers of
    introversion.
                            </p>

                                    <strong>Q: Was there ever a time when American society valued
    introverts more highly?</strong>
    
                                <br>
                                    <strong>A:</strong> In the nation&rsquo;s earlier years it was
    easier for introverts to earn respect. America once embodied
    what the cultural historian Warren Susman called a
    &ldquo;Culture of Character,&rdquo; which valued inner
    strength, integrity, and the good deeds you performed when no
    one was looking. You could cut an impressive figure by being
    quiet, reserved, and dignified. Abraham Lincoln was revered as
    a man who did not &ldquo;offend by superiority,&rdquo; as
    Emerson put it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    <strong>Q: You discuss how we can better embrace introverts in
    the workplace. Can you explain?</strong>
    
                                <br>
                                    <strong>A:</strong> Introverts thrive in environments that are
    not overstimulating&mdash;surroundings in which they can think
    (deeply) before they speak. This has many implications. Here
    are two to consider: (1) Introverts perform best in quiet,
    private workspaces&mdash;but unfortunately we&rsquo;re trending
    in precisely the opposite direction, toward open-plan offices.
    (2) If you want to get the best of all your employees&rsquo;
    brains, don&rsquo;t simply throw them into a meeting and assume
    you&rsquo;re hearing everyone&rsquo;s ideas. You&rsquo;re not;
    you&rsquo;re hearing from the most vocally assertive people.
    Ask people to put their ideas in writing before the meeting,
    and make sure you give everyone time to speak.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    <strong>Q: 
    <em>Quiet</em> offers some terrific insights for the parents of
    introverted children. What environment do introverted kids need
    in order to thrive, whether it&rsquo;s at home or at
    school?</strong>
    
                                <br>
                                    <strong>A:</strong> The best thing parents and teachers can do
    for introverted kids is to treasure them for who they are, and
    encourage their passions. This means: (1) Giving them the space
    they need. If they need to recharge alone in their room after
    school instead of plunging into extracurricular activities,
    that&rsquo;s okay. (2) Letting them master new skills at their
    own pace. If they&rsquo;re not learning to swim in group
    settings, for example, teach them privately. (3) Not calling
    them &ldquo;shy&rdquo;--they&rsquo;ll believe the label and
    experience their nervousness as a fixed trait rather than an
    emotion they can learn to control.
                            </p>

                                    <strong>Q: What are the advantages to being an
    introvert?</strong>
    
                                <br>
                                    <strong>A:</strong> There are too many to list in this short
    space, but here are two seemingly contradictory qualities that
    benefit introverts: introverts like to be alone--and introverts
    enjoy being cooperative. Studies suggest that many of the most
    creative people are introverts, and this is partly because of
    their capacity for quiet. Introverts are careful, reflective
    thinkers who can tolerate the solitude that idea-generation
    requires. On the other hand, 
    <em>implementing</em> good ideas requires cooperation, and
    introverts are more likely to prefer cooperative environments,
    while extroverts favor competitive ones.

        holds sway? What would a twenty-first-century Culture of
