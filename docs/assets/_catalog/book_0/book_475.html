                                <p>"Samuel Langhorne Clemens... better known by the pen name
    Mark Twain, was an American humorist, satirist, lecturer and
    writer. Twain is most noted for his novels Adventures of
    Huckleberry Finn, which has since been called the Great
    American Novel, and The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. He is also
    known for his quotations. During his lifetime, Clemens became a
    friend to presidents, artists, leading industrialists and
    European royalty.</p>
                                    
                                <p>
                                    Clemens enjoyed immense public popularity, and his keen wit
    and incisive satire earned him praise from both critics and
    peers. American author William Faulkner called Twain 'the
    father of American literature.'"
