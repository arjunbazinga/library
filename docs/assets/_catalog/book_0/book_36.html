                                <p>From the highly acclaimed, multiple award-winning Anthony
      Doerr, a stunningly ambitious and beautiful novel about a
      blind French girl and a German boy whose paths collide in
      occupied France as both try to survive the devastation of
      World War II.</p>
                                      
                                <p>Marie-Laure lives with her father in Paris near the Museum
      of Natural History, where he works as the master of its
      thousands of locks. When she is six, Marie-Laure goes blind
      and her father builds a perfect miniature of their
      neighborhood so she can memorize it by touch and navigate her
      way home. When she is twelve, the Nazis occupy Paris and
      father and daughter flee to the walled citadel of Saint-Malo,
      where Marie-Laure&rsquo;s reclusive great-uncle lives in a
      tall house by the sea. With them they carry what might be the
      museum&rsquo;s most valuable and dangerous jewel.</p>
                                      
                                <p>In a mining town in Germany, the orphan Werner grows up
      with his younger sister, enchanted by a crude radio they
      find. Werner becomes an expert at building and fixing these
      crucial new instruments, a talent that wins him a place at a
      brutal academy for Hitler Youth, then a special assignment to
      track the resistance. More and more aware of the human cost
      of his intelligence, Werner travels through the heart of the
      war and, finally, into Saint-Malo, where his story and
      Marie-Laure&rsquo;s converge.</p>

                                    Doerr&rsquo;s &ldquo;stunning sense of physical detail and
      gorgeous metaphors&rdquo; (
      <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>) are dazzling. Deftly
      interweaving the lives of Marie-Laure and Werner, he
      illuminates the ways, against all odds, people try to be good
      to one another. Ten years in the writing, 
      <em>All the Light We Cannot See</em> is a magnificent, deeply
      moving novel from a writer &ldquo;whose sentences never fail
      to thrill&rdquo; (
      <em>Los Angeles Times</em>).

                                          <strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, May 2014:</strong>
      Does the world need yet another novel about WWII? It does
      when the novel is as inventive and beautiful as this one by
      Anthony Doerr. In fact, 
      <em>All the Light We Cannot See</em>--while set mostly in
      Germany and France before and during the war--is not really a
      &ldquo;war novel&rdquo;. Yes, there is fear and fighting and
      disappearance and death, but the author&rsquo;s focus is on
      the interior lives of his two characters. Marie Laure is a
      blind 14-year-old French girl who flees to the countryside
      when her father disappears from Nazi-occupied Paris. Werner
      is a gadget-obsessed German orphan whose skills admit him to
      a brutal branch of Hitler Youth. Never mind that their paths
      don&rsquo;t cross until very late in the novel, this is not a
      book you read for plot (although there is a wonderful,
      mysterious subplot about a stolen gem). This is a book you
      read for the beauty of Doerr&rsquo;s writing-- &ldquo;Abyss
      in her gut, desert in her throat, Marie-Laure takes one of
      the cans of food&hellip;&rdquo;--and for the way he
      understands and cherishes the magical obsessions of
      childhood. Marie Laure and Werner are never quaint or twee.
      Instead they are powerful examples of the way average people
      in trying times must decide daily between morality and
      survival.

      chock full of beautiful imagery&hellip;Nothing short of
      brilliant,

      beautiful new book, but the circumstances are as elegantly
      circuitous as they can be.&hellip;Werner&rsquo;s experience at
      the school is only one of the many trials through which Mr.
      Doerr puts his characters in this surprisingly fresh and
      enveloping book. What&rsquo;s unexpected about its impact is
      that the novel does not regard Europeans&rsquo; wartime
      experience in a new way. Instead, Mr. Doerr&rsquo;s nuanced
      approach concentrates on the choices his characters make and
      on the souls that have been lost, both living and

      characters it has, Story Prize-winner Doerr&rsquo;s novel
      triumphs on both counts. Along the way, he convinces readers
      that new stories can still be told about this well-trod
      period, and that war&mdash;despite its desperation, cruelty,
      and harrowing moral choices&mdash;cannot negate the pleasures
      of the world.&rdquo; (

                                    &ldquo;This novel has the physical and emotional heft of a

                                <p>"What a delight! This novel has exquisite writing and a
      wonderfully suspenseful story. A book you'll tell your
      friends about..." (Frances Itani, author of Deafening)</p>
                                      
                                <p>&ldquo;This jewel of a story is put together like a
      vintage timepiece, its many threads coming together so
      perfectly. Doerr&rsquo;s writing and imagery are stunning.
      It&rsquo;s been a while since a novel had me under its spell
      in this fashion. The story still lives on in my head.&rdquo;

                                    &ldquo;
      <em>All the Light We Cannot See</em> is a dazzling, epic work
      of fiction. Anthony Doerr writes beautifully about the mythic
      and the intimate, about snails on beaches and armies on the
      move, about fate and love and history and those breathless,
      unbearable moments when they all come crashing
      together.&rdquo; (Jess Walter, author of Beautiful Ruins)
                                </p>
                                      
                                <p>
                                    &ldquo;Doerr sees the world as a scientist, but feels it
      as a poet. He knows about 
      <em>everything</em>&mdash;radios, diamonds, mollusks, birds,
      flowers, locks, guns&mdash;but he also writes a line so
      beautiful, creates an image or scene so haunting, it makes
      you think forever differently about the big
      things&mdash;love, fear, cruelty, kindness, the countless
      facets of the human heart. Wildly suspenseful, structurally
      daring, rich in detail and soul, Doerr&rsquo;s new novel is 
      <em>that</em> novel, the one you savor, and ponder, and
      happily lose sleep over, then go around urging all your
      friends to read&mdash;now.&rdquo; (J.R. Moehringer, author of
      Sutton and The Tender Bar)

                                <p>&ldquo;A tender exploration of this world's paradoxes; the
      beauty of the laws of nature and the terrible ends to which
      war subverts them; the frailty and the resilience of the
      human heart; the immutability of a moment and the healing
      power of time. The language is as expertly crafted as the
      master locksmith's models in the story, and the settings as
      intricately evoked. A compelling and uplifting novel.&rdquo;
      (M.L. Stedman, author of The Light Between Oceans)</p>
