                                    Khaled Hosseini, the #1 
      <em>New York Times</em>&ndash;bestselling author of 
      <em>The Kite Runner</em> and 
      <em>A Thousand Splendid Suns</em>, has written a new novel
      about how we love, how we take care of one another, and how
      the choices we make resonate through generations. In this
      tale revolving around not just parents and children but
      brothers and sisters, cousins and caretakers, Hosseini
      explores the many ways in which families nurture, wound,
      betray, honor, and sacrifice for one another; and how often
      we are surprised by the actions of those closest to us, at
      the times that matter most. Following its characters and the
      ramifications of their lives and choices and loves around the
      globe&mdash;from Kabul to Paris to San Francisco to the Greek
      island of Tinos&mdash;the story expands gradually outward,
      becoming more emotionally complex and powerful with each
      turning page.

                                          <strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, May 2013:</strong>
      Khaled Hosseini&rsquo;s 
      <em>And the Mountains Echoed</em> begins simply enough, with
      a father recounting a folktale to his two young children. The
      tale is about a young boy who is taken by a 
      <em>div</em> (a sort of ogre), and how that fate might not be
      as terrible as it first seems&mdash;a brilliant device that
      firmly sets the tone for the rest of this sweeping,
      heartbreaking, and ultimately uplifting novel. A day after he
      tells the tale of the 
      <em>div</em>, the father gives away his own daughter to a
      wealthy man in Kabul. What follows is a series of stories
      within the story, told through multiple viewpoints, spanning
      more than half a century, and shifting across continents. The
      novel moves through war, separation, birth, death, deceit,
      and love, illustrating again and again how people&rsquo;s
      actions, even the seemingly selfless ones, are shrouded in
      ambiguity. This is a masterwork by a master storyteller.

      <em>And the Mountains Echo</em>ed opens like a thunderclap. .
      . . [Hosseini] asks good, hard questions about the limits of
      love. . . . Love, Hosseini seems to say, is the great
      leveler, cutting through language, class, and identity.&nbsp;
      No one in this gripping novel is immune to its
      impact.&rdquo;&mdash;

      Hosseini makes it clear that he's not ready to rest on his
      Big Name. . . . While it hits all the Hosseini sweet
      spots&mdash;nostalgia, devastating details, triumph over the
      odds&mdash;
      <em>And the Mountains Echoed</em> covers more ground, both
      geographically and emotionally, than his previous works. It's
      not until Hosseini makes the novel small again, for the
      poignant conclusion, that you fully appreciate what he's
      accomplished.&rdquo;&mdash;

      expert manufacturer of that experience.&rdquo;&mdash;

      [Hosseini] gently molds and shapes individual pieces that
      ultimately fit together in a major work. . . . Family matters
      in ways small and large in this novel. Whether or not the
      connections are visible, they exist nevertheless. Hosseini
      seems to be telling us that the way we care is who we are
      and, ultimately, the face we show to life.&rdquo;&mdash;

                                    "Readers' tears may fall by first chapter's end . . .
      Introspective and perfectly paced, Hosseini's microcosmic
      plot spares no expense with sensory details. Each character .
      . . captivates. Hosseini skillfully weaves the tapestry with
      universal elements: human fallibility, innate goodness,
      perseverance, forgiveness, sexuality, jealousy,
      companionship, and joy. Yet his words are never sugarcoated:
      The brutality of life is on display, and people are shown
      just as they are, for better or worse. Poverty and gender
      roles leave scars, while shifting points of view reveal
      Hosseini's prism of truth. The heartbreaks are not intended
      for shock value, but they do linger. And the Mountains Echoed
      resonates to the core.&rdquo;&mdash;
