                                    Before. Miles &ldquo;Pudge&rdquo; Halter is done with his
      safe life at home. His whole life has been one big non-event,
      and his obsession with famous last words has only made him
      crave &ldquo;the Great Perhaps&rdquo; even more (Francois
      Rabelais, poet). He heads off to the sometimes crazy and
      anything-but-boring world of Culver Creek Boarding School,
      and his life becomes the opposite of safe. Because down the
      hall is Alaska Young. The gorgeous, clever, funny, sexy,
      self-destructive, screwed up, and utterly fascinating Alaska
      Young. She is an event unto herself. She pulls Pudge into her
      world, launches him into the Great Perhaps, and steals his
      heart. Then. . . . After. Nothing is ever the same.

                                    Grade 9 Up - Sixteen-year-old Miles Halter's adolescence
      has been one long nonevent - no challenge, no girls, no
      mischief, and no real friends. Seeking what Rabelais called
      the "Great Perhaps," he leaves Florida for a boarding school
      in Birmingham, AL. His roommate, Chip, is a dirt-poor genius
      scholarship student with a Napoleon complex who lives to
      one-up the school's rich preppies. Chip's best friend is
      Alaska Young, with whom Miles and every other male in her
      orbit falls instantly in love. She is literate, articulate,
      and beautiful, and she exhibits a reckless combination of
      adventurous and self-destructive behavior. She and Chip teach
      Miles to drink, smoke, and plot elaborate pranks. Alaska's
      story unfolds in all-night bull sessions, and the depth of
      her unhappiness becomes obvious. Green's dialogue is crisp,
      especially between Miles and Chip. His descriptions and
      Miles's inner monologues can be philosophically dense, but
      are well within the comprehension of sensitive teen readers.
      The chapters of the novel are headed by a number of days
      "before" and "after" what readers surmise is Alaska's
      suicide. These placeholders sustain the mood of possibility
      and foreboding, and the story moves methodically to its
      ambiguous climax. The language and sexual situations are
      aptly and realistically drawn, but sophisticated in nature.
      Miles's narration is alive with sweet, self-deprecating
      humor, and his obvious struggle to tell the story truthfully
      adds to his believability. Like Phineas in John Knowles's 
      <em>A Separate Peace</em>(S &amp; S, 1960), Green draws
      Alaska so lovingly, in self-loathing darkness as well as
      energetic light, that readers mourn her loss along with her
      friends.
