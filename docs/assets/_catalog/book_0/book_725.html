                            </p>
                            <span xmlns="" class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">Theodore
    John Kaczynski is an American mathematician and eventual
    neo-Luddite social critic who carried out a campaign of mail
    bombings. Kaczynski excelled in academics from an early age
    received and undergraduate degree from Harvard University and
    earned a PhD in mathematics from the University of Michigan. He
    became an assistant professor at the University of California,
    Berkeley, at age 25, but resigned two years later.
    
                                <br>
                                    
                                <br>
                                In 1971, he moved to a remote cabin without electricity
    or running water, in Lincoln, Montana, where he began to learn
    survival skills in an attempt to become self-sufficient. He
    decided to begin a bombing campaign after watching the
    wilderness around his home get destroyed by development. From
    1978 to 1995, Kaczynski sent 16 bombs to targets including
    universities and airlines, killing three people and injuring
    23.
    
                                <br>
                                    
                                <br>
                                In 1995, Kaczynski mailed several letters, some to his
    former victims, outlining his goals. Kaczynski also sent a
    letter to The New York Times on April 24, 1995, and promised
    &ldquo;to desist from terrorism&rdquo; if the Times or The
    Washington Post published his manifesto verbatim. In his
    Industrial Society and Its Future (also called the
    &ldquo;Unabomber Manifesto&rdquo;), he argued that his bombings
    were extreme but necessary to attract attention to the erosion
    of human freedom necessitated by modern technologies requiring
    large-scale organization. There was a great deal of controversy
    as to whether it should be done.
    
                                <br>
                                    
                                <br>
                                A subsequent letter threatening to kill more people was
    sent and the United States Department of Justice recommended
    publication out of concern for public safety. The pamphlet was
    then published by The New York Times and The Washington Post on
    September 19, 1995, with the hope that someone would recognize
    the writing style.
    
                                <br>
                                    
                                <br>
                                Throughout the manuscript, produced on a typewriter
    without the capacity for italics, Kaczynski capitalizes entire
    words in order to show emphasis. He always refers to himself as
    either &ldquo;we&rdquo; or &ldquo;FC&rdquo; (Freedom Club),
    though he appears to have acted alone. Writer Henry Holt notes
    that Kaczynski&rsquo;s writing, despite its irregular
    hyphenation, is virtually free of any spelling or grammatical
    error, in spite of its production on a manual typewriter
    without the benefit of a word processor or spell-checker.
    
                                <br>
                                    
                                <br>
                                Industrial Society and Its Future begins with
    Kaczynski&rsquo;s assertion that &ldquo;the Industrial
    Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the
    human race.&rdquo; The first sections of the text are devoted
    to psychological analyses of various groups&mdash;primarily
    leftists and scientists&mdash;and of the psychological
    consequences for the individual of life within the
    &ldquo;industrial-technological system.&rdquo; The later
    sections speculate about the future evolution of this system,
    argue that it will inevitably lead to the end of human freedom,
    call for a &ldquo;revolution against technology,&rdquo; and
    attempt to indicate how that might be accomplished.</span>
