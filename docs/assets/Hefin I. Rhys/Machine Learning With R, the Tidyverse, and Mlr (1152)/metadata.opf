&lt;p&gt;Summary Machine learning (ML) is a collection of programming techniques for discovering relationships in data. With ML algorithms, you can cluster and classify data for tasks like making recommendations or fraud detection and make predictions for sales trends, risk analysis, and other forecasts. Once the domain of academic data scientists, machine learning has become a mainstream business process, and tools like the easy-to-learn R programming language put high-quality data analysis in the hands of any programmer. Machine Learning with R, the tidyverse, and mlr teaches you widely used ML techniques and how to apply them to your own datasets using the R programming language and its powerful ecosystem of tools. This book will get you started! Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications. About the book Machine Learning with R, the tidyverse, and mlr gets you started in machine learning using R Studio and the awesome mlr machine learning package. This practical guide simplifies theory and avoids needlessly complicated statistics or math. All core ML techniques are clearly explained through graphics and easy-to-grasp examples. In each engaging chapter, youâ€™ll put a new algorithm into action to solve a quirky predictive analysis problem, including Titanic survival odds, spam email filtering, and poisoned wine investigation. What's inside Using the tidyverse packages to process and plot your data Techniques for supervised and unsupervised learning Classification, regression, dimension reduction, and clustering algorithms Statistics primer to fill gaps in your knowledge About the reader For newcomers to machine learning with basic skills in R. About the author Hefin I. Rhys is a senior laboratory research scientist at the Francis Crick Institute. He runs his own YouTube channel of screencast tutorials for R and RStudio.
