<strong>Bestseller</strong>
<strong>"An enormously smart, clear-eyed, brave-hearted, and
      quite personal look at the benefits of meditation."
      —Elizabeth Gilbert</strong> * 
      <strong>Nightline</strong>
<strong>*anchor Dan Harris embarks on an unexpected,
      hilarious, and deeply skeptical odyssey through the strange
      worlds of spirituality and self-help, and discovers a way to
      get happier that is truly achievable.</strong>
<em>After having a nationally televised panic attack, Dan
      Harris knew he had to make some changes. A lifelong
      nonbeliever, he found himself on a bizarre adventure
      involving a disgraced pastor, a mysterious self-help guru,
      and a gaggle of brain scientists. Eventually, Harris realized
      that the source of his problems was the very thing he always
      thought was his greatest asset: the incessant, insatiable
      voice in his head, which had propelled him through the ranks
      of a hypercompetitive business, but had also led him to make
      the profoundly stupid decisions that provoked his on-air
      freak-out. Finally, Harris stumbled upon an effective way to
      rein in that voice, something he always assumed to be either
      impossible or useless: meditation, a tool that research
      suggests can do everything from lower your blood pressure to
      essentially rewire your brain.  10% Happier</em>
       takes readers on a ride from the outer reaches of
      neuroscience to the inner sanctum of network news to the
      bizarre fringes of America’s spiritual scene, and
      leaves them with a takeaway that could actually change their
      lives. This paperback edition is revised with new
      material.
