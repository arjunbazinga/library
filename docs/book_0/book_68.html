<strong>Summary</strong>
</p>
<div xmlns="">
<p>**An NPR Book Concierge Best Book of 2018!</p>
<p>A stunning story about how power works in the modern
      age--the book the New York Times called "one helluva
      page-turner" and The Sunday Times of London celebrated as
      "riveting...an astonishing modern media conspiracy that is a
      fantastic read." Pick up the book everyone is talking
      about.**</p>
<p>In 2007, a short blogpost on Valleywag, the Silicon
      Valley-vertical of Gawker Media, outed PayPal founder and
      billionaire investor Peter Thiel as gay. Thiel's sexuality
      had been known to close friends and family, but he didn't
      consider himself a public figure, and believed the
      information was private.</p>
<p>This post would be the casus belli for a meticulously
      plotted conspiracy that would end nearly a decade later with
      a $140 million dollar judgment against Gawker, its bankruptcy
      and with Nick Denton, Gawker's CEO and founder, out of a job.
      Only later would the world learn that Gawker's demise was not
      incidental--it had been masterminded by Thiel.</p>
<p>For years, Thiel had searched endlessly for a solution to
      what he'd come to call the "Gawker Problem." When an unmarked
      envelope delivered an illegally recorded sex tape of Hogan
      with his best friend's wife, Gawker had seen the chance for
      millions of pageviews and to say the things that others were
      afraid to say. Thiel saw their publication of the tape as the
      opportunity he was looking for. He would come to pit Hogan
      against Gawker in a multi-year proxy war through the Florida
      legal system, while Gawker remained confidently convinced
      they would prevail as they had over so many other
      lawsuit--until it was too late.</p>
<p>The verdict would stun the world and so would Peter's
      ultimate unmasking as the man who had set it all in motion.
      Why had he done this? How had no one discovered it? What
      would this mean--for the First Amendment? For privacy? For
      culture?</p>
<p>In Holiday's masterful telling of this nearly unbelievable
      conspiracy, informed by interviews with all the key players,
      this case transcends the narrative of how one billionaire
      took down a media empire or the current state of the free
      press. It's a study in power, strategy, and one of the most
      wildly ambitious--and successful--secret plots in recent
      memory.</p>
<p>Some will cheer Gawker's destruction and others will
      lament it, but after reading these pages--and seeing the
      access the author was given--no one will deny that there is
      something ruthless and brilliant about Peter Thiel's shocking
      attempt to shake up the world. **</p>
