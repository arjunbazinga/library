<strong>Summary</strong>

<div xmlns="">
<p>
<strong>Updated and expanded with more than 80 pages of new
        content!</strong>
</p>
<p>
                                    Improve your athletic performance, extend your athletic
      career, treat stiffness and achy joints, and prevent and
      rehabilitate injuries—all without having to seek out a
      coach, doctor, chiropractor, physical therapist, or masseur.
      In 
      <em>Becoming a Supple Leopard,</em> Dr. Kelly
      Starrett—founder of MobilityWOD.com—shares his
      revolutionary approach to mobility and maintenance of the
      human body and teaches you how to hack your own movement,
      allowing you to live a healthier, more fulfilling life. This
      new edition of the 
      <em>New York Times</em> and 
      <em>Wall Street Journal</em> bestseller has been thoroughly
      revised to make it even easier to put to use.
                                </p>
<p>
                                    Want to truly understand the principles that guide human
      movement? 
      <em>Becoming a Supple Leopard</em> lays out a blueprint for
      moving safely and effectively through life and sport. Want to
      learn how to apply those principles to specific movements,
      whether you are doing squats in the gym or picking up a bag
      of groceries? Hundreds of step-by-step photos show you not
      only how to perform a host of exercise movements, such the
      squat, deadlift, pushup, kettlebell swing, clean, snatch, and
      muscle-up, but also how to correct the common faults
      associated with those movements. Frustrated because you
      can’t perform a certain movement correctly due to range
      of motion restrictions? Breaking the body down into 14
      distinct areas, Starrett demonstrates hundreds of
      mobilization techniques that will help you resolve
      restrictions and reclaim your mobility. Unsure how to put it
      all together into a program that addresses your individual
      needs? This updated edition lays out dozens of prescriptions
      that allow you to hone in on a specific limitation, a nagging
      injury, or an exercise fault that you just can’t seem
      to get right. It even offers a 14-day full-body mobility
      overhaul.
                                </p>
<p>
                                    Performance is what drives us as human beings, but
      dysfunctional movement patterns can bring the human body to
      an abrupt halt. Often, the factors that impede performance
      are invisible even to seasoned athletes and coaches. 
      <em>Becoming a Supple Leopard</em> makes the invisible
      visible. Whether you are a professional athlete, a weekend
      warrior, or simply someone wanting to live healthy and free
      from physical restrictions, this one-of-a-kind training
      manual will teach you how to harness your athletic potential
      and maintain your body.
                                </p>
