<strong>Summary</strong>
</p>
<div xmlns="">

<strong>Poker champion turned business consultant Annie
        Duke teaches you how to get comfortable with uncertainty
        and make better decisions as a result.</strong>
</p>
<p>In Super Bowl XLIX, Seahawks coach Pete Carroll made one
      of the most controversial calls in football history: With 26
      seconds remaining, and trailing by four at the Patriots'
      one-yard line, he called for a pass instead of a hand off to
      his star running back. The pass was intercepted and the
      Seahawks lost. Critics called it the dumbest play in history.
      But was the call really that bad? Or did Carroll actually
      make a great move that was ruined by bad luck?</p>
<p>Even the best decision doesn't yield the best outcome
      every time. There's always an element of luck that you can't
      control, and there is always information that is hidden from
      view. So the key to long-term success (and avoiding worrying
      yourself to death) is to think in bets: How sure am I? What
      are the possible ways things could turn out? What decision
      has the highest odds of success? Did I land in the unlucky
      10% on the strategy that works 90% of the time? Or is my
      success attributable to dumb luck rather than great decision
      making?</p>
<p>Annie Duke, a former World Series of Poker champion turned
      business consultant, draws on examples from business, sports,
      politics, and (of course) poker to share tools anyone can use
      to embrace uncertainty and make better decisions. For most
      people, it's difficult to say "I'm not sure" in a world that
      values and, even, rewards the appearance of certainty. But
      professional poker players are comfortable with the fact that
      great decisions don't always lead to great outcomes and bad
      decisions don't always lead to bad outcomes.</p>
<p>By shifting your thinking from a need for certainty to a
      goal of accurately assessing what you know and what you
      don't, you'll be less vulnerable to reactive emotions,
      knee-jerk biases, and destructive habits in your decision
      making. You'll become more confident, calm, compassionate and
      successful in the long run. **</p>
