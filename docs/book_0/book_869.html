<strong>Summary</strong>
</p>
<div xmlns="">
<p>The catastrophic collapse of companies such as Enron,
      WorldCom, ImClone, and Tyco left angry investors, employees,
      reporters, and government investigators demanding to know how
      the CEOs deceived everyone into believing their companies
      were spectacularly successful when in fact they were
      massively insolvent. Why did the nation's top accounting
      firms give such companies clean audit reports? Where were the
      regulators and whistleblowers who should expose fraudulent
      CEOs before they loot their companies for hundreds of
      millions of dollars? In this expert insider's account of the
      savings and loan debacle of the 1980s, William Black lays
      bare the strategies that corrupt CEOs and CFOs—in
      collusion with those who have regulatory oversight of their
      industries—use to defraud companies for their personal
      gain. Recounting the investigations he conducted as Director
      of Litigation for the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, Black
      fully reveals how Charles Keating and hundreds of other
      S&amp;L owners took advantage of a weak regulatory
      environment to perpetrate accounting fraud on a massive
      scale. He also authoritatively links the S&amp;L crash to the
      business failures of the early 2000s, showing how CEOs then
      and now are using the same tactics to defeat regulatory
      restraints and commit the same types of destructive fraud.
      Black uses the latest advances in criminology and economics
      to develop a theory of why "control fraud"—looting a
      company for personal profit—tends to occur in waves
      that make financial markets deeply inefficient. He also
      explains how to prevent such waves. Throughout the book,
      Black drives home the larger point that control fraud is a
      major, ongoing threat in business that requires active,
      independent regulators to contain it. His book is a wake-up
      call for everyone who believes that market forces alone will
      keep companies and their owners honest. **</p>
