<strong>Summary</strong>
</p>
<div xmlns="">
<p>PREFACE.</p>
<p>In consequence of the wide circulation of the Life of Sir
      Isaac Newton, which I drew up for the " Family Library " in
      1831, I was induced to undertake a larger work, in order to
      give a more detailed account of his Life, Writings, and
      Discoveries. For this purpose I applied in 1837 to the
      Honourable Newton FeUowes, one of the trustees of the Earl of
      Portsmouth, for permission to inspect the Manuscripts and
      Correspondence of Sir Isaac, which, through his grandniece,
      Miss Conduitt, afterwards Lady Lymington, had come into the
      possession of that noble family. Mr. FeUowes kindly granted
      my request, and his amiable and accomplished son, Mr. Henry
      Arthur FeUowes, who, had he Uved, would now have been Earl of
      Portsmouth, met me in June 1837, at Hurtsbourne Park, to
      assist me in examining and making extracts from the large
      mass of papers which Sir Isaac had left behind him.</p>
<p>In this examination our attention was particularly
      directed to such letters and papers as were calculated to
      throw light upon his early and academical life, and, with the
      assistance of Mr. FeUowes, who copied for me several
      important documents, I was enabled to collect many valuable
      materials unknown to preceding biographers.</p>
<p>After the death of Sir Isaac, his nephew, Mr. Conduitt,
      drew</p>
<p>up a memorial, containing a sketch of his life, for the
      use of Fontenelle, the Secretary to the Academy of Sciences
      in Paris, whose duty it was to write his Eloge, as one of the
      eight Associates of the Academy. This memorial was published
      by Ed-mond Turnor, Esq., in his " Collections for the History
      of the Town and Soke of Grantham," and was supposed to
      contain all the information that Mr. Conduitt could collect
      from persons then alive, and from other sources, respecting
      Sir Isaac's life. This, however, was a mistake. After the
      publication of Fon-tenelle's Eloge, Mr. Conduitt resolved to
      draw up a Life of his illustrious relative, and, with this
      view, he wrote the following letter, requesting the
      assistance of Sir Isaac's personal friends :'—</p>
<p>" Gth February 172|.</p>
<p>" Sir, —I have taken the liberty to trouble you with
      some short hints of that part of our honoured friend, Sir I.
      Newton's life, which I must beg the favour of you to
      undertake, there being nobody, without dispute, so well
      qualified to do it as yourself. I send you, at the same time,
      FonteneUe's Eloge, wherein you will find a very imperfect
      attempt of the same kind ; but I fear he had neither
      abilities nor inclination to do justice to that great man,
      who had eclipsed the glory of their hero, Descartes. As Sir
      I. Newton was a national man, I think every one ought to
      contribute to a work intended to do him justice, particularly
      those who had so great a share in his esteem as you had; and
      as I pretend to nothing more than to compile it, I shall
      acquaint the public in the Preface, to whom they are indebted
      for each particular part of it.</p>
<p>1 This letter is docqueted by Conduitt, " Letter sent by
      me concerning Sir I. N.'s Inventions."</p>
<p>" I am persuaded that the hints I have sent you are
      very-imperfect, and that your own genius will suggest to you
      many others much more proper and significant, and I beg of
      you to put down everything that occurs to your thoughts, and
      you think fit to be inserted in such a work.</p>
<p>" I conjure you not to put off what I take the liberty to
      recommend to you. As on one hand the complying with my
      request will be a mark of your gratitude to your old friend,
      and an eternal obligation on me, so your delaying it will be
      the most mortifying disappointment to,</p>
<p>" Sir,</p>
<p>" Your most humble Servant,</p>
<p>" John Conduitt."^</p>
<p>Although Mr. Conduitt had at this time resolved to compile
      a Life of Sir Isaac, and had obtained much information from
      Dr. Stukely, Mr. Wickins, and Dr. Humphrey Newton of
      Grantham, yet he seems to have so far relinquished his
      design, that in June 1729, nearly eighteen months after the
      date of his letter, he intimates to a friend^ that " he has
      some thoughts of writing the Life of **</p>
