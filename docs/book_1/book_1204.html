<strong>Summary</strong>
</p>
<div xmlns="">
<p>We all face disease and death, and rely on the medical
      profession to extend our lives. Yet, David Wootton argues,
      from the fifth century BC until the 1930s, doctors actually
      did more harm than good. In this controversial new account of
      the history of medicine, he asks just how much good it has
      done us over the years, and how much harm it continues to do
      today. - ;Just how much good has medicine done over the
      years, and how much harm does it continue to do? The history
      of medicine begins with Hippocrates in the fifth century BC.
      Yet until the invention of antibiotics in the 1930s doctors,
      in general, did their patients more harm than good. In this
      fascinating new look at the history of medicine, David
      Wootton argues that for more than 2300 years doctors have
      relied on their patients' misplaced faith in their ability to
      cure. Over and over again major discoveries which could save
      lives were met with professional resistance. And this is not
      just a phenomenon of the distant past. The first patient
      effectively treated with penicillin was in the 1880s; the
      second not until the 1940s. There was overwhelming evidence
      that smoking caused lung cancer in the 1950s; but it took
      thirty years for doctors to accept the claim that smoking was
      addictive. In the 1960s there was the notorious thalidomide
      tragedy, while today there is the ongoing problem of
      unnecessary operations, especially in the United States - and
      this all at a time of rapidly rising healthcare costs. As
      Wootton graphically illustrates, throughout history and right
      up to the present, bad medical practice has often been deeply
      entrenched and stubbornly resistant to evidence. This is a
      bold and challenging book - and the first general history of
      medicine to acknowledge the frequency with which doctors do
      harm. - ;A sad but fascinating story of centuries of missed
      opportunities, unnecessary suffering and misplaced faith in
      outlandish remedies. - Nick Rennison, Sunday Times
      Culture;The historical catastrophe of medicine has never been
      so excitingly and stirringly told. - Druin Birch, Times
      Literary Supplement;David Wotton [creates] a genuinely
      thrilling adventure out of the abysmal failings of doctors
      over the past 2000 years. - Druin Birch, Times Literary
      Supplement;A very stimulating and thought-provoking book. -
      Theodore Dalrymple, Sunday Telegraph;Ought to be required
      reading for every first year medical student. - British
      Medical Journal;lucid, elegantly written and pleasingly slim
      book - Will Cohu, Sunday Telegraph</p>
