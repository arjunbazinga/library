<strong>Summary</strong>

<p>What others in the trenches say about The Pragmatic
      Programmer... “The cool thing about this book is that
      it’s great for keeping the programming process fresh.
      The book helps you to continue to grow and clearly comes from
      people who have been there.” —Kent Beck, author
      of Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change “I
      found this book to be a great mix of solid advice and
      wonderful analogies!” —Martin Fowler, author of
      Refactoring and UML Distilled “I would buy a copy, read
      it twice, then tell all my colleagues to run out and grab a
      copy. This is a book I would never loan because I would worry
      about it being lost.” —Kevin Ruland, Management
      Science, MSG-Logistics “The wisdom and practical
      experience of the authors is obvious. The topics presented
      are relevant and useful.... By far its greatest strength for
      me has been the outstanding analogies—tracer bullets,
      broken windows, and the fabulous helicopter-based explanation
      of the need for orthogonality, especially in a crisis
      situation. I have little doubt that this book will eventually
      become an excellent source of useful information for
      journeymen programmers and expert mentors alike.”
      —John Lakos, author of Large-Scale C++ Software Design
      “This is the sort of book I will buy a dozen copies of
      when it comes out so I can give it to my clients.”
      —Eric Vought, Software Engineer “Most modern
      books on software development fail to cover the basics of
      what makes a great software developer, instead spending their
      time on syntax or technology where in reality the greatest
      leverage possible for any software team is in having talented
      developers who really know their craft well. An excellent
      book.” —Pete McBreen, Independent Consultant
      “Since reading this book, I have implemented many of
      the practical suggestions and tips it contains. Across the
      board, they have saved my company time and money while
      helping me get my job done quicker! This should be a desktop
      reference for everyone who works with code for a
      living.” —Jared Richardson, Senior Software
      Developer, iRenaissance, Inc. “I would like to see this
      issued to every new employee at my company....”
      —Chris Cleeland, Senior Software Engineer, Object
      Computing, Inc. “If I’m putting together a
      project, it’s the authors of this book that I want. . .
      . And failing that I’d settle for people who’ve
      read their book.” —Ward Cunningham Straight from
      the programming trenches, The Pragmatic Programmer cuts
      through the increasing specialization and technicalities of
      modern software development to examine the core
      process--taking a requirement and producing working,
      maintainable code that delights its users. It covers topics
      ranging from personal responsibility and career development
      to architectural techniques for keeping your code flexible
      and easy to adapt and reuse. Read this book, and you'll learn
      how to Fight software rot; Avoid the trap of duplicating
      knowledge; Write flexible, dynamic, and adaptable code; Avoid
      programming by coincidence; Bullet-proof your code with
      contracts, assertions, and exceptions; Capture real
      requirements; Test ruthlessly and effectively; Delight your
      users; Build teams of pragmatic programmers; and Make your
      developments more precise with automation. Written as a
      series of self-contained sections and filled with
      entertaining anecdotes, thoughtful examples, and interesting
      analogies, The Pragmatic Programmer illustrates the best
      practices and major pitfalls of many different aspects of
      software development. Whether you're a new coder, an
      experienced programmer, or a manager responsible for software
      projects, use these lessons daily, and you'll quickly see
      improvements in personal productivity, accuracy, and job
      satisfaction. You'll learn skills and develop habits and
      attitudes that form the foundation for long-term success in
      your career. You'll become a Pragmatic Programmer.</p>
